# @chuyik/husky

> Git hooks made easy

This is a fork of [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) v4 with a few changes:

- prevents git hooks skipped on GUI app like Tower / SourceTree with [run-node](https://github.com/sindresorhus/run-node)
- throws error if hook is skipped

# install

```sh
yarn install --dev @chuyik/husky
```
